DigiTracker / DigiRecognizer RELEASE PLAN:
- Create branch (e.g. v_2.0), then 
- Create release candidate branch (e.g. v_2.0.0rc), 
- Add Release folder to release candidate branch (and update the file version number), then finally 
- Tag the release (e.g. Release_2.0.0) from the modified release candidate branch.
