  <h1>Sentinel System Driver Installation for Windows 9x/NT/ME/2000</h1>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Versions 5.39 and later of the Sentinel System Driver use the Windows Installer 
  which allows you to install the driver on any Windows 9x/NT/2000 system as if 
  it were a regular application. This document describes the installation procedure 
  for the Sentinel System Driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Legacy Installation</h2>
<p>If you are installing the driver for DOS, Windows 3.x, OS/2, or any non-Intel 
  Windows NT machine, you must use the old installer. The old installer is located 
  in the<i> /Legacy</i> directory of the driver media. The old installer has been 
  kept to allow developers that are not yet ready to migrate to the Windows Installer 
  to keep their old installation methods. There are some limitations to doing 
  this, however. The old installer does not support installing only the USB driver; 
  you must use the new installer to do that. </p>
<p>Also, the legacy installer does not properly upgrade the USB driver on Windows 
  2000. If you use the legacy installer to install the driver over a previous 
  installation on Windows 2000, you will have to manually update the USB driver 
  through the Device manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Using Merge Modules</h2>
<p>The following sections assume you will use the provided <i>setup.exe</i> file, 
  with or without command-line options, to install the driver on your end user's 
  system. If instead you wish to use the supplied merge modules to seamlessly 
  add the Sentinel System Driver installation to your own application's installation, 
  see <a href="mergemodules.htm">Sentinel System Driver Windows Installer Merge 
  Modules</a> for instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="InstallProc"></a>Installation Procedure</h2>
<p><b>Upgrade Note: </b>You are not required to upgrade to the latest driver. 
  If you are currently using the previous version of the Sentinel System Driver, 
  and everything is working satisfactorily, you do not need to upgrade. However, 
  if you wish to upgrade to the latest version of the driver, you must first uninstall 
  the previous driver by using the Windows <b>Add/Remove Programs</b> icon in 
  the <b>Control Panel</b> before following the instructions below.</p>
<table border="1" width="90%" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td height="72"> 
      <p><b>WARNING: </b>When you run <i> setup.exe</i> to install the driver, 
        it will automatically update your version of the Windows Installer if 
        necessary. It will not provide any prompts before doing this. If you are 
        not sure you want to update the Windows Installer, do not run this program.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: </b>Remove any USB Sentinel SuperPro keys before continuing 
  the installation. See <a href="#USB">Important Note on Sentinel SuperPro USB 
  Keys</a> for details.</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p>If you have the driver on CD, place the CD in the computer and, if Autorun 
      is enabled, the installation program should automatically run. Otherwise, 
      run <i>setup.exe</i> from the root directory of the driver media. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>If you do not have the correct version of the Windows Installer, it will 
      automatically be installed for you. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p> If setup detects an older version of the Sentinel System Driver, you will 
      be prompted to confirm the upgrade. The older version is uninstalled immediately 
      after you confirm the upgrade. If you exit the installation after this, 
      the older version will not still be installed. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>Select either <b>Complete</b> or a <b>Custom</b> installation. <b>Complete</b> 
      will install both the parallel and USB driver. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>If you select <b>Custom</b> (and if the operating system on which you are 
      installing supports USB), you can choose whether to install parallel, USB, 
      or both. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>Select <b>Install</b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p> Depending on the operating system you are using and the configuration 
      of your computer, you may be asked to reboot if you have performed an upgrade. 
      This is necessary to start the new parallel driver. </p>

<h2><a name="addinstall"></a>How Do I Add the Driver Installation to My Own Installer?</h2>
<p>There are four basic methods of installing the Sentinel System Driver onto 
  an end user's computer using the installer on this CD. </p>
<p>If you are installing your application using a non Windows Installer installation 
  package, then you must use methods 1 or 2. Developers that use Windows Installer 
  can use any of the four methods. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><b>Have the users run the driver install themselves - </b>Since the supplied 
      installer contains a full step-by-step installation just like any application, 
      most end users will be able to install the driver themselves. This can easily 
      be added to autorun menus or automatically run at the end of the application 
      installation. It can be included on your own application CD with instructions 
      on how to install. You can also burn your own copies of the Sentinel System 
      Driver CD and distribute them with your product. If you are trying to run 
      the installation from a menu or your own installer, you need only call the 
      Sentinel System Driver's <i>setup.exe</i> file. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Run the driver installation quietly - </b>Either during your installation, 
      or after your installer finishes, you can call the Sentinel System Driver 
      installation in quiet mode. The driver installation is then run without 
      any required user interaction. <a href="#InstallOptions">Command-line switches</a> 
      are used to do this. This method is very similar to the first method, except 
      you call <i>setup.exe</i> yourself with the required switches to run without 
      outputting messages (quiet mode). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Your Windows Installer package calls the Rainbow Windows Installer package 
      -</b> If your installer is written for Windows Installer, you can easily 
      call the Sentinel System Driver installation directly from its <i>.msi </i>file. 
      This is a supported custom action built into Windows Installer. The trick 
      to using this method is allowing the installer to find the files it needs 
      to install. The Sentinel System Driver, written using InstallShield for 
      Windows Installer, has all its files placed in the archive <i>data.cab</i>. 
      It is very possible that if you use InstallShield for Windows Installer 
      you also have a <i>data.cab</i> file. In this case, the two <i>data.cab</i> 
      files would have to be merged together (since all the files have to reside 
      in one directory). If your installer does not require a <i>data.cab</i> 
      file, just include this file on your CD. You will then place the <i>Sentinel 
      System Driver.msi</i> file in the same directory as your own <i>.ms</i>i 
      file. After you add a custom action to call the Sentinel System Driver's 
      <i>.msi</i> file from your installer, the driver will be installed quietly 
      right along with your application in a seamless fashion. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Use the Sentinel System Driver merge modules -</b> In order to do this, 
      your installation package must use Windows Installer. This method is probably 
      the most difficult, but allows you the most flexibility with installation 
      options. With this method, the Sentinel System Driver is not just installed 
      alongside your own installer; it actually becomes part of your installer. 
      One of the advantages of this method is that the Sentinel System Driver 
      cannot be removed unless your application is uninstalled. Thus, even if 
      other applications try to remove the Sentinel System Driver, Windows Installer 
      will realize that another application requires this component. The driver 
      is not removed until ALL applications that require it are removed first. 
      <a href="MergeModules.htm">Using the merge modules</a> is fully documented 
      in this installation guide. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>When including the Sentinel System Driver on your own CD, only six files are 
  required, totaling about 4 MB: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Sentinel System Driver.msi </i></li>
  <li><i>Data.cab </i></li>
  <li><i>Setup.exe </i></li>
  <li><i>Setup.ini </i></li>
  <li><i>Instmsia.exe </i></li>
  <li><i>Instmsiw.exe </i></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using method 3, then you need only two files that total about 800 
  KB: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Sentinel System Driver.msi </i></li>
  <li><i>Data.cab </i></li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend, however, that you include the entire contents of the Sentinel 
  System Driver CD onto your own application CD as long as you have room. This 
  keeps the distribution complete. Most developers make a subdirectory on their 
  CD for the driver and place the entire CD contents in that folder. The entire 
  driver CD takes up less than 10 MB of space. </p>
<p>Another alternative is to point your end users to the Rainbow Technologies 
  Web site (<i>http://www.rainbow.com</i>) where they can download the latest 
  version of the Sentinel System Driver themselves. Assuming your customers are 
  on the Internet already, this prevents you from having outdated versions of 
  the driver being shipped with your application. </p>
<h2><a name="InstallOptions"></a>Installation Options</h2>
<p>The <i>setup.exe</i> program checks your version of the Windows Installer, 
  updates it if necessary, and then calls on the Windows Installer to install 
  the Sentinel System Driver from the <i>.ms</i>i file. You can pass on any command-line 
  options to the Windows Installer via <i>setup.exe</i> using the /v option. Multiple 
  options are placed with quotation marks; any option that requires a quotation 
  mark should be prefaced with a \. As an example: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Setup.exe /v"/qn INSTALLDIR=\"c:\program 
    files\driver\"" </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above line will install the driver quietly (without prompts) into the <i>c:\program 
  files\driver</i> directory. For more information on the Windows Installer and 
  its command-line options, go to Microsoft's MSDN Web site. Some valid Windows 
  Installer command-line options are as follows (see the MSDN Web site for complete 
  information on all options): </p>
<p><b>Note: </b>The column titled &quot;/v Argument&quot; indicates whether the 
  option must be placed within the /v quotation marks or whether it is used outside 
  of the /v option.</p>

      <p>This property fully uninstalls the USB SuperPro driver when set. (It 
        only works during uninstallation of the entire package.)</p>
      <p>The USB SuperPro driver is a Plug 'n' Play (PnP) driver that is WHQL 
        (Windows Hardware Quality Labs) certified on Windows 2000. According to 
        Microsoft specifications, a PnP driver should never be uninstalled from 
        a system even if the hardware is removed. This is because PnP only loads 
        in the drivers for components actually plugged into the computer. When 
        the device is removed, the driver is never loaded. Uninstalling it risks 
        inadvertently causing a problem with the entire operating system. </p>
      <p>For this reason, the USB driver is never fully uninstalled by default 
        by the installer. Some developers desire the ability to completely remove 
        all traces of the USB driver from a computer. This action is intended 
        for this, but should be used at your own risk. If this property is set, 
        all traces of the USB driver are removed from the system. In general, 
        the computer should be rebooted if this occurs, although the installer 
        will not specifically prompt to do so. It is possible for there to be 
        multiple installations of the Sentinel System Driver on a computer. This 
        action does not check to see if there are other installations on the computer. 
        Running it may require a re-install or repair to make the USB driver operational 
        again for another application. </p>
      <p>This property only affects Windows 2000 systems. Other operating systems 
        fully uninstall the driver. </p>

<p> There are three features that can be set using the above ADDLOCAL, REMOVE, 
  or REINSTALL properties on the Sentinel System Driver: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>ConfigFiles</b> - This contains the necessary configuration and help 
      files for the Sentinel System Driver. This option should always be installed. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Parallel_Driver </b>- This feature installs the parallel port driver 
      for any Rainbow Technologies hardware security keys. </p>

    <p><b>USB_Driver </b>- This feature installs the USB SuperPro driver. It is

<h2><a name="USB"></a>Note on USB Sentinel SuperPro Keys</h2>
<p>All USB Sentinel SuperPro keys need to be removed before installing or removing 
  the Sentinel System Driver. Otherwise, the USB portion of the installation might 
  fail. For this reason, we recommend providing some sort of warning to the user 
  to remove any USB SuperPro keys from the computer before performing the installation. 
  In the case of the supplied installer, it warns the user on the Install Confirmation 
  dialog just before any real installation takes place. If a user fails to heed 
  this warning then you should have the user uninstall and re-install the Sentinel 
  System Driver without the USB key plugged in. This should repair the system 
  and make the USB key operational. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="DriverConfig"></a>Driver Configuration Program</h2>
<p>This version of the driver contains a new driver configuration program. It 
  is located in the <i>C:\Program Files\Rainbow Technologies\Sentinel System Driver</i> 
  directory unless you change the install directory. It is called <i>SetupSysDrvr.exe 
  </i> and it can be run by double-clicking it. When you run it, a window will 
  come up. It will give you a few configuration choices as well as tell you what 
  version of the driver it detects. If you only have the USB driver installed 
  and you do not have any USB keys plugged in, it will not detect the driver. 
  This is because the USB driver is loaded by Plug-n-Play whenever a key is plugged 
  in. If there is no USB key plugged in, the driver is not loaded yet. The parallel 
  driver is always loaded, so if you install it, the configuration program should 
  always detect its presence. </p>
<h3>Add/Repair/Remove Installation</h3>
<p>If you select this option, the installer will run the Windows Installer for 
  the Sentinel System Driver and allow you to modify components, repair the installation, 
  or remove the installation. This option is the same as going to the <b>Control</b> 
  <b>Panel</b>, <b>Add/Remove Programs</b> and selecting the <b>Sentinel System 
  Driver</b>. If the driver configuration program does not detect the installed 
  driver, you can point it to the <i>Sentinel System Driver.msi</i> file that 
  was used to install the driver originally. This should be located with the driver 
  media you received when you installed the driver. Browse to the file, click 
  <b>OK</b> and it will run the installer for you. </p>
<h3>Configure Driver</h3>
<p>This option allows you to manually configure the parallel ports used by the 
  Sentinel System Driver. In general, the driver is able to automatically detect 
  your parallel ports and does not need to be set up manually. In some cases, 
  manual modifications are necessary and this option allows you to do this. Any 
  changes to the ports could potentially cause the driver to fail. For more information 
  on changing the ports and what the various options mean, select this option 
  and then select help. </p>
<h3>Start/Stop NT Parallel Driver</h3>
<p>This option allows you to stop and start the NT parallel driver. This also 
  works in Windows 2000 (sometimes referred to as Windows NT 5.0). Use this option 
  to manually cycle the driver. This option has no effect on the USB driver, which 
  is automatically stopped and started whenever a key is removed or inserted.
