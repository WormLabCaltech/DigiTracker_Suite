This document explains the current limitations and particularities when using
MIL with VGA (subject to change in future releases). 

Contents

 1. VGA limitations.
 2. Obsolete functions.
 3. Important display notice.


1. VGA limitations.

   - When using a G450 revision D or a G550 stand-alone MGA board, the PAL,
     PAL-YC, and CCIR formats are not supported. However the NTSC format is
     supported on all G450 and G550 revisions.

2. Obsolete functions.

   - The functions MvgaDispAllocDIBInfo() and MvgaDispFreeDIBInfo(),
     documented in the VGA chapter of the Board-Specific notes manual, are
     now obsolete.

3. Important display notice: 
 
    Typically, if you want to display one or many color images in a window on the 
    Windows desktop screen (e.g. using the M_WINDOWED display type), the display 
    update of these image buffers can be much faster if they are allocated in 
    M_RGB24+M_PLANAR format. Note that this depends on your VGA(s) configuration, 
    operating system, and the display options that you are using 
    (e.g. such as non-destructive overlay).
