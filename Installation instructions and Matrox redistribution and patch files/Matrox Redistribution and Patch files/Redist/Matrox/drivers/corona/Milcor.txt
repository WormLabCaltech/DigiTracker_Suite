1. Matrox Corona with MIL/ActiveMIL.

   - When enabling the encoder in PAL resolution under Windows 98 in single- 
     screen mode, if the Matrox display properties program asks you to reboot, 
     you must do it immediately. Afterwards, you should continue at the point 
     from which you left.
   
2. Matrox Corona with MIL.

2.1 Mdig...() additions/modifications.

   - MdigControl():
     - M_GRAB_EXPOSURE_BYPASS is only supported in the manual exposure model 
       (M_ENABLE).  

   - MdigGrab():
     - Only supports grabbing from a 2 tap camera, if the camera is in an odd-
       even line configuration. That is, one tap is transmitting the odd lines 
       while the other tap is transmitting the even lines.
                            
   - MdispHookFunction():
     - Not supported.

  2.2 Mdisp...() additions/modifications.

   - MdispPan():
     - Not supported in non-windowed mode.

   - MdispZoom():
     - Not supported in non-windowed mode.


   -Important display notice: 
 
    Typically, if you want to display one or many color images in a window on the 
    Windows desktop screen (e.g. using the M_WINDOWED display type), the display 
    update of these image buffers can be much faster if they are allocated in 
    M_RGB24+M_PLANAR format. Note that this depends on your VGA(s) configuration, 
    operating system, and the display options that you are using 
    (e.g. such as non-destructive overlay).


3. Matrox Corona with ActiveMIL.

3.1 Digitizer control additions/modifications.

     - The GrabExposureBypass method is only supported when the manual exposure
       model = True.
     - The Grab method only supports grabbing from a 2 tap camera, if the camera 
       is in an odd-even line configuration. That is, one tap is transmitting 
       the odd lines while the other tap is transmitting the even lines. 

3.2 Display control additions/modifications.

     - The FrameStart event is not supported.
     - The Pan and Zoom methods are not supported.
