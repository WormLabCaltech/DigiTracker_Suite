1. Matrox Cronos with MIL.

1.1 Limitations, particularities, and last minute information for Matrox
    Cronos.

- MdigChannel()
    - Fast channel switching is not supported on Matrox Cronos revision 0. It
      is supported on Matrox Cronos revision 1 and higher.

- MdigHookFunction()
    - When performing fast channel switching:
           - It is possible that the field type is not correctly detected for
             the first grabbed field or frame after a channel switch. For example
             in frame mode it is possible to receive 2 hooks of M_GRAB_FIELD_END_ODD
             without receiving the hook of M_GRAB_FIELD_END_EVEN. In field mode it
             is possible to receive a hook of M_GRAB_FIELD_END_ODD when it should have
             been an even. The hooks of M_GRAB_START, M_GRAB_END, M_GRAB_FRAME_START,
             M_GRAB_FRAME_END and M_GRAB_FIELD_END are always correctly generated.

           - For the first grabbed field of frame after a channel switch the hooks of
             M_FRAME_START, M_FIELD_START, M_FIELD_START_ODD and M_FIELD_START_EVEN are
             not generated.

- MsysHookFunction() is not yet implemented.


2. Matrox Cronos with ActiveMIL.

   - All bug fixes and known bugs discussed in this file apply to Matrox
     Cronos with ActiveMIL as well.
