Description of this release
===========================

Matrox PowerDesk software includes a display driver and display 
utilities. With this software, you can take full advantage of your 
Matrox graphics hardware and you can access additional Matrox 
display-related features.


Installation
============

To install Matrox PowerDesk, start the "setup" program included 
with it, then follow the on-screen instructions.

The setup program will only install software if a Matrox graphics 
card model supported by the setup program is installed in your 
computer.


New features
============

This software includes new features, especially for Matrox 
hardware with DualHead support. These include:

- The use of different DualHead features (Multi-Display, DVDMax, 
  Zoom, and Clone) *without* restarting Windows

- Easier-to-use interface for DualHead controls

- Controls for dividing graphics resources (memory and bandwidth) 
  between your main and secondary displays

- More features accessible through user-defined hot keys 
  (keyboard shortcuts)


More information
================

For more information on Matrox PowerDesk, see the help file 
included with it. For information specific to your Matrox 
graphics card, see your Matrox or system manual.


Notes, problems, and limitations
================================

- Installation in different language versions of Windows

  If you install software in a language different from the 
  language of your operating system (for example, English software 
  on a Japanese system), you may have problems with text and 
  dialog box controls being cut off. This is because of 
  differences in system fonts.

- OpenGL (3D) support

  If you have a newer Matrox product or your Matrox software 
  was provided by the manufacturer of your computer, full 
  OpenGL support may be disabled with your Matrox display 
  driver. For a Matrox display driver with full OpenGL support 
  enabled, see the Matrox Web site (www.matrox.com/mga). (If 
  your Matrox product was provided by the manufacturer of your 
  computer, check the Web site of that manufacturer for a 
  display driver. A display driver provided by the manufacturer 
  of your computer is more likely to be tested with your 
  computer model.)

- Video playback with DualHead modes

  If you have a a DualHead supporting graphics card and you're 
  using DualHead Multi-Display, Clone, or Zoom mode, digital video 
  may appear as a solid color on your secondary display. This can 
  happen if video is played using the hardware-overlay feature of 
  your Matrox graphics card. Video played using the overlay 
  feature is generally of higher quality but it can be viewed only 
  on your main display.

  Because only one program at a time can use the overlay feature, 
  any other program started while the overlay feature is used 
  won't be able to use the feature. The overlay feature will be 
  available to the first program to start after the program 
  currently using the overlay is closed.

  For video that normally uses the hardware-overlay feature, you 
  may be able to view the digital video on your secondary display 
  by running another instance of the video player or by using a 
  video player that dynamically supports both hardware-overlay and 
  non hardware-overlay video playback (such as Microsoft Media 
  Player 7).

- 15-bit color palette support for Windows 2000/XP

  For advanced users: By default, the 15-bit color palette is 
  unavailable for Windows 2000/XP. If you need to use this color 
  palette, you can make it available by adding the 
  "User.Enable15Bpp" value to your Windows registry and then 
  setting this value to "1". If you're adding this value, add it 
  under "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" > "SYSTEM" > "CurrentControlSet" > 
  "Services" > "mgau" or "g200" or "g400" > "Device0". The value 
  type is "REG_DWORD".
